# instructions:

- `/workspaces/codespaces-blank/Instructions-README.MD`
Process this role from "Alex email Checklist" and build evidence table.

## Target Skills (7 key requirements)
1. **Project documentation & organization** — READMEs, setup guides, technical documentation showing structured communication
2. **Issue/task tracking** — GitHub Issues, project boards, or evidence of organized task management
3. **Agile/iterative practices** — commit patterns, incremental delivery, continuous improvement artifacts
4. **Cross-functional collaboration** — multi-repo coordination, working across different technology stacks
5. **Risk/issue tracking** — changelog files, issue resolution patterns, dependency management
6. **Technical fluency** — understanding of software development (evident through repo structure, configs, deployment scripts)
7. **Process implementation** — CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, workflow standardization (GitHub Actions, Docker, config management)

## Search Strategy
- **Priority repos**: Look for comprehensive READMEs, GitHub workflows, docker-compose files, organized repo structures, issue templates
- **Evidence types**: Documentation files, CI/CD configs, project organization, commit message quality, multi-repo patterns, setup/deployment scripts
- **Line citations required**: Exact file paths with #Lx-Ly ranges

## Output Requirements
- **Max 5 rows** in `./out/Project-Coordinator-678714WD/table_rows.md`
- **Relevance scoring**: 5=exact match, 4=close, 3=related, 1-2=tangential
- **Verdict** (50-80 words) in `./out/Project-Coordinator-678714WD/verdicts.md`: assess match quality, gaps, transferability

## Constraints
- Search only Gaya56's GitHub repos
- Cite real files only (no guessing)

Since this role emphasizes soft skills (communication, organization), look for **tangible evidence**:
- Quality documentation = communication skills
- Organized repo structure = organizational skills
- Consistent commit patterns = follow-through
- CI/CD implementation = process orientation
- Multi-repo management = cross-functional coordination
