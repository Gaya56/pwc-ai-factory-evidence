# UX/UI GenAI Developer, Senior Associate — 669127WD Verdict

**Match Quality**: Excellent front-end skills demonstrated. ChatBot-Vite shows production-grade React/Vite development with HTML, responsive CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript/JSX component architecture. Git workflows evident across repos. However, NO jQuery usage found (modern React approach instead), NO Adobe XD/Figma/Photoshop collaboration artifacts, and limited GenAI tool integration evidence beyond general AI chatbot development. Strong modern front-end developer profile but missing traditional jQuery and design tool collaboration requirements. Relevance: 4-5/5 for modern front-end, 2/5 for jQuery/design tools.
