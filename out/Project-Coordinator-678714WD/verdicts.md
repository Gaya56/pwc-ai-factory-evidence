# Project Coordinator — 678714WD Verdict

**Match Quality**: Exceptional project coordination capabilities demonstrated through tangible artifacts. Comprehensive documentation (11KB README), automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions (multi-stage testing, Docker builds, integration tests), Docker Compose orchestration across multiple services (postgres, agent_service, streamlit_app), and multi-repo management. Evidence shows strong organizational skills, process implementation, technical fluency, and cross-functional coordination. Missing: explicit Jira/Azure DevOps usage, but GitHub workflows/issues provide equivalent functionality. Relevance: 5/5 for demonstrable project coordination skills.
