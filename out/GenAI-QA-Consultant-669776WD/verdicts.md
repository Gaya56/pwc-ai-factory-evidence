# GenAI QA Consultant — 669776WD Verdict

**Match Quality**: Moderate-to-strong transferable skills demonstrated. Testing_AGENTS repo shows comprehensive test automation (pytest, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Docker integration tests, codecov). However, evidence lacks Azure-specific tooling (no AKS, Azure DevOps, or Azure Test Automation). API testing not explicitly shown with Postman/RestAssured. Strong on general QA automation principles and AI agent testing but missing PwC's Azure-centric requirements. Relevance: 3-4/5 range.
