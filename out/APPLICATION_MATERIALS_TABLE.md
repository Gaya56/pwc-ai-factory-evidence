## Common Themes (Use Across All Roles)

**Production Experience:**
- Docker/Kubernetes orchestration across multiple environments
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions
- Multi-service architecture management

**Technical Strengths:**
- Python expertise (async/await, FastAPI, pytest)
- Container orchestration (Docker Compose, K8s)
- Comprehensive technical documentation
- GenAI application development (LangGraph, Anthropic)

**Gap Mitigation Strategy:**
